function id = makeuniqueid(time)
%MAKEUNIQUEID Generates a unique ID to use on a DataSet.
% This function returns a string which is almost certainly unique. It
% comprises the user's login name, the computer's name, the timestamp (in
% miliseconds) when the ID was generated and an additional random number.
%
% The only conditions under which this will not be unique is if the system
% clock is at the exact same moment in time (in miliseconds) and the random
% number generator happens to be in the exact same state. As this is nearly
% impossible, the uniqueness of this string is virtually guaranteed.
