%ReadMeDataSet
% This README lists the procedures for updating the DataSet
% object and includes a running list of the release dates,
% version (e.g. for DataSet h: h.datasetversion), and comments
% on changes from previous versions.
%
% Full documentation of the DataSet Object can be found at:
%
% http://www.wiki.eigenvector.com/index.php?title=DataSet_Object
%
%I) When updating the DATASET object:
%
%I.A) Version number (double) must be changed in:
% 1) constructor dataset.m
% 2) overloaded loadobj.m
%
%I.B) Version changes follow the convention:
%  for Version xx.yy.zz
% 1) xx is incremented if object fields are changed or added
%   a) update DISPLAY, HELP, SUBSREF, SUBSASGN, CAT
% 2) yy is incremented if object methods are changed or added (leading to
%    non-backwards compatible objects)
% 3) zz is incremented for bug-fixes and changes in methods which are
%    backwards compatible with previous released version.
%
%I.C) As of version 5.0, the following functions need to be modified if a
%  field is added to the DSO.
%    cat 
%    dataset
%    display
%    loadobj
%    permute
%    readmedataset
%    reshape
%    set
%    squeeze
%    subsasgn
%    subsref 
%
%II) Update notes:
%Release Dates  Version  Comments
%   12-04-12     6.0.2
%                        Add simple plot functionality
%                        Add search functionality
%                        Modify load object method to assure history field always reflects the load of an object
%                        Note in history when load object changes NaN classes to zeros
%                        Added updateset method to allow updating/adding label sets automatically without knowing which set index to use. 
%                        Added findset method to allow locating label sets automatically without knowing which set index to use. 
%                        Add error checking when assigning entire imageaxisscale field
%                        Allow assignment directly onto imageaxisscale
%                        Clarify that axistype is being shown in () after each axisscale
%                        Fix mistaken use of varargin. Threw error if trying to sortby a DSO when the DSO wasn't passed directly into sortby (e.g. through another function or after an subsref call)
%                        Discontinue throwing of error when user attempts to index into non-existent but otherwise valid set. Instead simply return an empty (of appropriate type). This makes set indexing more friendly (the set doesn't exist, but it CAN exist, so returning empty value is more valid than throwing error)
%                        Allow indexing by single index when ROW vector (e.g. x(1:5) when x is a row vector should return COLUMNS 1-5)
%                        More memory-friendly handling of in-place sub-assignment (portion) of data
%                        Direct subscripting assignments into dataset.data will operate without making a duplicate copy
%                        Improve history record of event including calling function
%                        Fix && to & in if statement. && can't handles more than a scalar.
%                        Fix of userinfotag (two locations:  @dataset/private and utilities) for problems when running with unusual directory names (e.g. parallels)
%                        Make sure indexes into DSOs are vectorized (to avoid accidental creation of matrices from things like classes)
%                        Add sparse, issparse, and full to DSO per helpdesk/ticket 942.
%                        Allow empty string to be interpreted as 'none' for axistype
%                        Change warning to give mode, set, and replaced value and REPEAT warning for each time we do this.
%                        Remove limitation on the warnings (always give it)
%                        loadobj.m
%                          -change logic to replace NaN's with zero ONLY if not currently used. otherwise use first unused negative value.
%                          -update class lookup table after changing classes
%                          -change evriwarndlg to be simple warning (and give each time a DSO is loaded with NaN's)
%                        subsasgn.m
%                          -minor change to wording of warning
%                          -change evriwarndlg to be simple warning
%                        Automatically convert NaN's in class assignments to zeros
%                        Add a permute (to put data in correct order if imagemode > 1 and useimagemode='off')
%Release Dates  Version  Comments
%   10-10-10     6.0.1
%                        Added ability to index into batch DSOs using cell notation (converts given batch to 'data' type) 
%                        Add string precedence for merging class lookup tables.
%                        Add virtual field for included data, mydata.data.include
%                        Fix for label/class direct indexing into dataset, returns empty if can't find.
%                        Fix for duplicate name values.
%                        Modified .include call to ONLY use indexing IF there is something excluded (more memory and time friendly)
%                        Fix for transposed include field.
%                        Fix for wrong new class number, was causing duplicate numeric values in class lookup table.
%                        Fix for removing last set.

%                         SUBSREF adapted for use with single, uint8, etc.
%   5-03-01               SUBSREF added indexing into data using ()s (e.g. x.data(1:5,:) )
%   4-22-01               LOADOBJ updated version check #, fixed string comparison bug (version number as
%                         stored is STRING), fixed update code to copy non-dataset object first before updating,
%                         made version comparison & update incremental (do all which are needed),
%                         added set of DataSetVersion field
%   4-20-01               DELSAMPS fixed parentesis bug: changed "}" to ")"
%                         fixed index bug e.g. if includ = 6:10 and user asked to remove 8, it wouldn't
%                         remove anything BUT if user asked to remove 2, 7 would be removed)
%   4-12-01               SET fixed includ error if adding data to empty dataset
%                         SUBSASNG fixed includ error if adding data to empty dataset
%   4-11-01               SUBSASGN nearly the same as SET for datasets except added logic to take input like a
%                         SUBSASGN call and translate it into the correct info for the old SET routine
%                         fixed error in errors (missing [ ]s)
%                         modified error statements to make more sense with SUBSASGN call
%                         changed history logging function (renamed old one to keep it)
%                         SUBSREF converted from DATASET/GET
%                         added indexing into history vs. GET which doesn't allow that
%  10-10-00        2.01   DATASET add type = batch(cell), add includ {cell}, add history(cell)
%                         DISPLAY allow for type = batch(cell), add includ, history
%                         LOADOBJ, GET, SET add includ(cell) and history(cell)
%                         HORZCAT, VERTCAT not defined for batch
%                         added DELSAMPS method for soft delete (hard not yet available)
%  10-06-00        1.05   changed SET lines 218, 220, 222 to label, axisscale,
%                         axisscalename repspectively. changed help in GET.
%  09-01-00        1.04   changed SET to input a date when empty when using SET
%                         changed datasetdemo.m
%  08-30-00        1.03   beta,
%                         added moddate,
%                         added horizontal concatenation,
%                         vertical concatenation,
%                         changed display to not include 0x0 (must not
%                          be empty to see MxN)
%                         get moddate and datasetversion
%                         made moddate and date setable only if initially empty
%                         set moddate and datasetversion errors
%  08-17-00        0.02   beta,
%                         added SET field input can be cell,
%                         GET data can be data(:,1) (indexing capability)
%                         XPLDST overloaded for DATASET objects
%  08-16-00        0.01   beta, initial release
%  08-03-00        0.00   alpha
